# Integration Testing Report for Pyinstrument
## Test integration profiler
### Test Design Summary
This integration test covered the interaction between the Profiler core module, responsible for managing profiling lifecyce and collecting call stack samples and the output renderer module which formats and produces human readable profiling reports. The test verified the profiling of a synchronous workload function and confirmed accurate data capture and output generation.

### Test Data Preparation
The test daata consisted of a simple synchronous python function defined inside the test which computes the sum of numbers from 0 to 999. The profiling output text generated by the renderer was collected and analyzed for correctness.

### Execution and Results
The test was run using pytest. The profiler was started before executing the workload and stopped thereafter. Assertions validated that:

- The workload function returned the correct result
- The profiler output contained expected markers indicating profiling activity
- Internal profiler details were not leaked in outputs

The test succeeded without defects confirming correct integration of the profiler core and output renderer modules for synchronous profiling scenarios.

### Bug Reports
No bugs or defects were identified during this integration test

## Integration Test for Profiler and HTML Renderer
### Test Design Summary
This integration test validated the interaction between the Profiler core module that is responsible for managing the profiling lifecycle and collecting call stack samples, and the HTMLRenderer module, which formats profiling data into a human-readable HTML report. The goal was to confirm that profiling data captured during execution can be correctly rendered into an HTML output without errors or data loss.

### Test Data Preparation
The test data consisted of a simple synchronous workload function defined inside the test that computed the sum of integers from 0 to 200. This workload served as the profiled code segment to verify that performance samples were properly collected and rendered.

### Execution and Results
The test was executed using pytest. The profiler was started before invoking the workload and stopped immediately afterward. The recorded session was passed to the HTMLRenderer for conversion to HTML output. Assertions confirmed that:
- The workload function returned the correct numerical result
- The renderer produced a valid HTML string containing expected markup
- The rendered output referenced the profiled function name, confirming proper data capture and formatting
- The test completed successfully with no assertion failures, demonstrating that the profiler and renderer modules integrated correctly for synchronous profiling scenarios

### Bug Reports
No bugs or defects were identified during this integration test

## Test Integration for Profiler and JSON Renderer
### Test Design Summary
This integration test checked the interaction between the Profiler core module that manages the profiling lifecycle, collecting call stack samples, and the JSONRender module, which converts profiling data into a human-readable JSON File. The test was small, to confirm that the profiling infrastructure supports JSON outputs for downstream usage and consumption.

### Test Data Preparation
I went with a loop, since it would quickly make function calls that would appear throughout the profiling. The loop goes through numbers 0 to 999, showing how many times the loop is referenced inside the JSON report

### Execution and Results
The Test was conducted using pytest inside of a WSL Ubuntu venv. With profiler being called, the test went under way and in my findings:
- The test ran successfully
- The renderer made a valid JSON file with data parsed into a python dict
- The test completed without an assertation failure
- Render pathway behaved as intended

### Bug Reports
