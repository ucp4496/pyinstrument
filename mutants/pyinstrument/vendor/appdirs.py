            it is the owning company name. This falls back to appname. You may
            pass False to disable it.
        "version" is an optional version path element to append to the
            path. You might want to use this if you want multiple versions
            of your app to be able to run independently. If used, this
            would typically be "<major>.<minor>".
            Only applied when appname is present.
        "opinion" (boolean) can be False to disable the appending of
            "Logs" to the base app data dir for Windows, and "log" to the
            base cache dir for Unix. See discussion below.

    Typical user log directories are:
        Mac OS X:   ~/Library/Logs/<AppName>
        Unix:       ~/.cache/<AppName>/log  # or under $XDG_CACHE_HOME if defined

        Vista:      C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\<AppAuthor>\<AppName>\Logs

    On Windows the only suggestion in the MSDN docs is that local settings
    go in the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA` directory. (Note: I'm interested in
    examples of what some windows apps use for a logs dir.)

    OPINION: This function appends "Logs" to the `CSIDL_LOCAL_APPDATA`
    value for Windows and appends "log" to the user cache dir for Unix.
    This can be disabled with the `opinion=False` option.
